## Inspiration

The idea for the Space Memory Card Game came from our passion for space and the desire to create a fun and engaging game that challenges players' memory skills while immersing them in an intriguing space-themed environment.

## What it does
Space Memory Card Game is a classic memory card game with a space twist. Players are presented with a grid of cards featuring planets, galaxies, and black holes, all represented by animated GIFs from https://deep-fold.itch.io/ . The goal of the game is to match pairs of identical cards by remembering their positions and flipping them over within a given time limit. 

## How I built it
I built the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I utilized the CSS Grid layout to create a responsive grid of cards, and JavaScript for the game logic and interactions. The cards feature animated GIFs for a visually appealing experience. The timer functionality was implemented using JavaScript's `setTimeout` and `setInterval` methods.

## Challenges I ran into

I faced challenges in the card flipping animations, ensuring that the cards would not be clickable when hidden, and properly managing the timer functionality. Through research, and debugging, I overcame these obstacles and refined the game experience.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
I am proud of creating a visually appealing and engaging game with smooth animations. I am also proud of the timer mechanism, which adds an extra layer of challenge to the game and encourages players to improve their memory skills in order to increase the time limit.

## What I learned
Throughout the development process, I learned the importance of planning and organizing the projects code, as well as the benefits of using modern web development techniques like CSS Grid. I also gained experience with JavaScript's built-in timer functions and refined our problem-solving skills.

## What's next for Space Memory Card Game
In the future, I plan to expand the Space Memory Card Game with additional features, such as:
- Multiple difficulty levels with varying grid sizes and time limits
- A leaderboard to encourage competition among players
- And I would like to incorporate it into a Domain through goDaddy and host the other games I plan to make during this week on the same site.
